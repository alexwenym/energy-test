# Energy test with optimised permutations

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/113197119.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/113197119)

The [energy test](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0309164) is a method for determining if two samples orginate from the same underlying distribution. This implimention can efficiently make use of multiple CPUs, with support for using scaled permutations as described in [JINST 13 (2018) no.04, P04011](https://inspirehep.net/record/1648453).

For an implimentation that can be used with NVIDIA GPUs, which may be faster for unscaled calculations with large samples (> 10‚Å∑ points), see [Manet](https://manet.hepforge.org/).

## Compiling

### macOS with gcc

This assumes gcc has been installed using homebrew.

```bash
g++-7 -o energy_test -std=c++1z -O3 -march=native -Wall -I. energy_test.cpp -fopenmp
```

### Manchester machines

```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/external/gcc/6.2.0/x86_64-slc6-gcc62-opt/setup.sh
g++ -o energy_test -std=c++1z -O3 -march=native -Wall -I. energy_test.cpp -fopenmp
```

### lxplus

```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/external/gcc/6.2.0/x86_64-slc6-gcc62-opt/setup.sh
g++ -o energy_test -std=c++1z -O3 -Wall -I. energy_test.cpp -fopenmp
```

## Input data

The data is assumed to be in space separated text files and a script is included can create a suitable file (assuming `root_pandas` in installed):

```bash
./prepare_data.py  --input-fn=data/raw/sample0.root --output-fn-D0=data/csv/sample0-d0.csv --output-fn-D0bar=data/csv/sample0-d0bar.csv
```

## Running

Run the energy test for the input data only:

```bash
time ./energy_test sample1.csv sample2.csv
```

Run the energy test for the input data only, limiting the input files to 10000 events:

```bash
time ./energy_test --max-events=10000 sample1.csv sample2.csv
```

Run the energy test with permutations for 10000 points from sample 1 and 11000 points from sample 2:

```bash
time ./energy_test --max-events-1=10000 --max-events-2=11000 --n-permutations=100 sample1.csv sample2.csv
```


# Further Analysis 

To understand and improve upon the energy test, further tests are done. Fundamentally, the energy test consists of a few steps: finding the distances between all the points in each sample as well as across both samples, and then collapsing th sum of these distances into a test statistic T. It is unknown where the performance comes from specifically. 

The goal is to test if we can achieve a comparable level of sensitivity at each step of the process. If so, we have a good idea of where the power of the energy test originates. 

## Runs A

This is fundamentally concerned with the simple distance distributions of each sample; it introduces a few ways of comparing the distance distributions of the two samples (no cross terms - think of the first two terms in the energy test) to see if any statistical significance can be found. The distance we are concerned with is the euclidean distance in the dalitz space - we do not yet use a metric function. 

## Runs B 

This is more gearing towards the energy test - it compares the sum of the distance distributions of the first two terms against the distribution of the third term. There are certain runs which are promising. 

## Runs C 

This is essentially applying the energy test, but instead of calculating a single T value for each permutation, we find the T value for each bin, of which each permutation has a certain number of. We then run a chi2 test on the entire resulting distribution against a null hypothesis of a flat function at 0. This method is not shown to be particularly effective, and should only be revisited if significant changes are made. 

## Variants 

Runs A-C were primarily testing with smaller data samples using python and ROOT scripts. The variants folder contains several most promising tests, each with a modified copy of the original multiprocess energy-test application for more efficient computation on large datasets on the order of 50k events. 

### energy-test-deltamean & energy-test-deltamean-cross 

Designed to compare the difference in means between the matter and antimatter distance distributions as the test statistic. The cross version does the same thing but compares the means of the sum of the matter and antimatter distance distributions against the 'cross' distribution represented by the third term in the energy test. 

### energy-test-higherorder & energy-test-higherorder-cross

Like deltamean, except this variant also introduces, at a cost of greater computational demand, the ability to also compare the standard deviation, RMS, skewness, and kurtosis in addition to the mean. The cross version is the same idea as 'cross' above. 

### energy-test-cut & energy-test-cut-cross 

Instead of taking a delta parameter as input, this version takes a cut as an input and makes this cut on the euclidean distance distributions of the matter and antimatter plots. The test statistic is the difference in counts on one side of the cut between the two distributions. It does not matter which side of the cut is counted since the normalied samples should have the same difference on either side of the cut. The cross term refers to the same idea as above. 

In a way this method is a simplified version of applying the distance metric, and then counting up the numbers in a very specific bin.
